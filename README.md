# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This guide serves as a helpful too for individuals working through the coding BootCamp. it contains notes and helpful hints on HTML, CSS, Git and JS.

I wanted to provide a library of sorts for reference for myself as well as others to follow to assist in the completion of the BootCamp
The reason for building this project was to use the knowledge that I had gained through the prework course to implement and provide myself with a tool to use during and after the course has been completed.
This solves a major issue I was struggling with. Where do I store this information?!
As a spreadsheet guy, my initial goal was to compile everything into a sheet. Seems kind of silly to revert back to old habits. Especially when the tools I was learning to use were far superior.
By building this storage site of sorts, I was able to gain hands-on experience and play around in a sandbox environment. I learned how to manipulate the page and contents to suit my style and needs.
